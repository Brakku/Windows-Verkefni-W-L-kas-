Why would you ever change the default virtual memory page file settings in Windows?
With a default installation, Windows creates the virtual memory page file in the root folder on the same drive, where the systems files are stored. Over time, this drive may run out of free space, which would cause system problems. You could free up space on that drive by moving the virtual memory page file to a different drive. Another reason you may want to move the virtual memory page file is that possibly you have added a faster drive, an SSD for example, and you want to move your virtual memory page file to that drive in an attempt to speed up Windows response times.

It allows you to uninstall newly installed driver software and revert back to the driver that was used prior to a driver upgrade. The button is grayed out because a new driver has not been installed.
